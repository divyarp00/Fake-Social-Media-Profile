## Description
This project is developed by the Hacktive Architects team, focuses on detecting and reporting fake social media accounts. Fake social media accounts can pose serious risks, including spreading misinformation, cyberbullying, and illegal activities. Our project combines a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Twitter's API with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for effective fake account detection.

## Technologies Used:
*Python:* This is the programming language in which our project is primarily developed.

*tkinter:* tkinter is a Python library used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In our project, it's used to build the user interface for our application.

*Twitter API:* Twitter API is used to access Twitter's data and functionality programmatically. In our project, it's used to retrieve user data from Twitter for analysis.

*scikit-learn:* scikit-learn is a popular Python library for machine learning. It provides tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more. In our project, it's used for implementing the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the AdaBoost classifier for fake account detection.

*matplotlib:* matplotlib is a Python library for creating data visualizations, including charts and graphs. In our project, it may be used for visualizing data or results from the machine learning process.

*Keras:* Keras is a high-level deep learning framework that provides a user-friendly interface for building and training neural networks. It is built on top of other popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Theano, allowing developers to create, train, and deploy deep learning models with ease.
in Keras; we used Sequential as model, then we used SGD(Stochastic Gradiant Descent), after that used layers like Dense, BatchNoramalization, Activation Function, and Dropout.

Each of these technologies plays a big role in project's development and functionality. Listing them in README.md file helps provide clarity to readers about the technical aspects of the project and the tools and libraries that have been utilized. This information can be valuable for developers who may want to understand the technology stack and possibly contribute to the project.

## Features

- GUI-based interface for easy user interaction.
- ANN-based fake account detection with AdaBoost classifier.
- Notable accuracy improvement from 47% to 99% during the prediction phase.
- Predicts whether a user account is fake or real.

## Usage
Launch the GUI application using the provided Python script.
Enter user profile data for analysis.
Click the "Detect" button to predict if the user account is fake or real.
Use the "Report" button to submit a report for suspicious accounts.
